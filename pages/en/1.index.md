title: Introduction
description: GeoSpoc uses Deep Learning to unlock the potential of satellite images. We will be developing two separate models; one to detect rural Schools and another for Hospitals and a single visualization platform that hold outcomes from both the models. Maharashtra, our area of interest in this phase is likely to be extended pan INDIA post croudsourced validation of the model predictions!
This is an initiative funded by the UNICEF to establish an inclusive community of Deep Learning Researchers & Remote Sensing Scientists for the development and exchange of best practices in Deep Learning for Earth Objects Detection (Schools/Hospitals in this case!).
