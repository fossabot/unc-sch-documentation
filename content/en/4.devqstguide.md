## Data : Getting Mapbox's Satellite Basemap tiles
<p> </p>
[here](https://github.com/geospoc/unc-sch-01).

## Deep Learning Model 
<p>The U-net model used requires less training data. The model is a deep CNN which learns segmentation in an end-to-end setting.</p>

## Training the model

## Obtaining Predictions
<p>Rural School Predictions can be obtained from the following</p> [weights and scripts](https://github.com/geospoc/unc-sch-01/tree/master/prediction_scripts)

### Filtering unwanted Tiles 
<p>Planetscope data is used to filter buitup area and download corresponding Mapbox Tiles for Predictions. Corresponding codebase can be found</p> [here] (https://github.com/geospoc/unc-gis-planet-download)
